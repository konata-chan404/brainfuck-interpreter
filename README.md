# The Thing
The thing is a  brainfuck interpeter without the "," operator written in Python and heavily "inspired" by https://github.com/pocmo/Python-Brainfuck. 


# Usage
You can use the thing by doing ```./brainfuck.py [file]``` in bash in linux or mac (i added a nice alias that does the thing if you write brainfuck on my machine) and thats pretty much it i think
